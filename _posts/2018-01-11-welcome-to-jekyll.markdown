Just this, then bed.

I've been sleeping irregularly lately. Waking up too early at best, in the middle of the night at worst. A past girlfriend would've told me I've been 'activated'. Myself, I blame it on stress. Self-induced stress.

It started with last year's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com). A colleague mentioned it, said I should give it a go. I shrugged, gave it a half-hearted go, and was hooked. There's no crack of dawn during winter in Norway, just darkness, but I was up all the same, eagerly awaiting the day's puzzles, not finding rest until they were done. I relished the challenges, to use my brain for something _real_ for a change (although really, it wasn't _that_ real), instead of just generating `if`s and `else`s for a living.

Then Christmas came and went, and with it the puzzles.

But my brain kept spinning. I stumbled across [exercism](http://exercism.io) and installed [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). I want to learn Rust. But I also want to pick up LISP again, and Prolog and Smalltalk, all of which I made acquaintance with during my studies a quarter of a century ago, but never since.

So I dug out the old code snippets that had been languishing in Dropbox and decided they needed a promotion. To GitHub, no less. But how? To each snippet its own repository seemed like total overkill. Then I come across [kvz](http://kvz.io)'s [depreciation hack](http://kvz.io/blog/2014/02/21/how-to-deprecate-projects-on-github/), and apart from the fact that I'm not at all ashamed of my old code, it was a perfect fit.

So since yesterday, there it is, my [scrapbook](https://github.com/andersblehr/Scrapbook). 

And now this. This site has held nothing but a static 'Hello World' `index.html` file for almost a year. I wanted to do more, but despite my 25 years in the business, I had never done web development. Yes, irrational though it may sound, web development intimidated me.

But as fate would have it, I interviewed for an iOS gig, got it, and then priorities shifted and they tossed Smarty, Laravel and Ionic at me instead. It's been over 6 months now, and the sticky spider web tangle that is HTML/CSS/JavaScript is much less of a tangle in my head now.

So now this.

There may be more. But now bed.
