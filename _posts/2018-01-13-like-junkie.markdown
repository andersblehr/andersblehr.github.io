I had almost weaned myself of Facebook and my subconscious was seriously toying with the idea of logging off for good. For a while already it had been relegated to an incognito tab in my browser, and I felt an aversion to opening the app on my phone. It could go days between each time I checked my feed.

But then I'd get a notification.

I like to get things out of the way. I read my emails when I get them, and I clear my app notifications. But when you're not constantly engaged on Facebook, the notifications you get turn into this:

> Bob has shared a photo.

> Alice has updated their status.

> You have a new friend suggestion: <Somebody you met only once and hardly even remember, so how the _f*ck_ does Facebook know?>.

In plain English:

> Don't leave us, we likes you, come back to our [precious](https://youtu.be/Iz-8CSa9xj8) community!

So I closed that incognito tab and locked down the app's permissions, even blocking notifications. It was liberating. Not the momentous, giant burden off my shoulders type of liberating – more like a marked, lasting sense of relief. (Yes. My name is Anders, and I am a [like junkie](https://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/12410/confessions-of-a-facebook-like-junkie/).)

I went weeks without logging in. The app icon on my phone felt like a relic of the past. And then I wrote [that first post](https://andersblehr.github.io/2018/01/11/just-this.html) – and duly shared it. On Facebook.

I got a few likes. But the number of times I logged in to check for likes, was higher. So this morning I deleted the link from my profile. I'm back on the wagon and it's been 36 hours since my last share.

Think I'll try Twitter for this one.
