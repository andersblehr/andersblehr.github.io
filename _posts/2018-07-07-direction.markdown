I have a dedicated desktop on my Mac with a number of editors open for personal projects. There's a VSCode instance where I'm typing this now and also [bend Minima to my will](https://andersblehr.github.io/under-construction/), and another where I've done 47 [Haskell Exercism exercises](http://exercism.io/andersblehr). It's been almost a month since my last submission, but I keep it open: despite realising that Exercism is good for dipping your toes, but not for real learning, I enjoy Haskell's mathematic rigour and perfect execution once I've 'beaten the compiler'.

(A tiny bird keeps whispering that the academic route might have been a better fit for me than the long and winding road that's taken me to this moment. It's too late now anyway. This is the road.)

I also have the code for my app [Origon](https://github.com/andersblehr/Scrapbook#origon---shared-contact-lists-2015) open in Xcode, as well as the accompanying Java backend code in Eclipse. I haven't touched either code base in over a year, and I probably won't in the foreseeable future, either. But there's gold buried there: The replication and caching engine that seamlessly mirrors updates between users and devices might be useful for a others out there.

I also have a some old documents open that detail the inner workings of a [generic rules engine](https://github.com/andersblehr/Scrapbook#reactive-rules-engine-1999) I built 19 years ago. There may be gold buried here as well.

Then on my work desktop one three-finger swipe to the left I have PhpStorm and Toad for Oracle (running on a Windows VM) open on a project I'm doing for my current client. I've made headway these past few days and it's shaping up. I feel something resembling pride.

Or at least a sense of accomplishment.

For I'm doing the full, deep stack for this. All the way from vector graphics in Sketch, through Laravel Blade templates made pretty with CSS and dynamic with JS, via a REST API that over OCI8 invokes stored procedures in the beast that is Oracle, where I alter tables and views and write PL/SQL. (Just as I did with the rules engine all those 19 years ago. It hasn't changed much.) The API also interfaces with our partner's REST endpoints, where there's an intricate OAuth and cross-site JS dance going on.

It's been a long and frustrating haul, but when all the components decide to finally come together and play nice – as they do now – it feels almost like a symphony.

Until they don't and it doesn't.

But yes, overall I get frustrated. I'm spread too thin and have too little direction. I need some direction.
