I am an independent developer with over 25 years consulting and IT experience. I have worked as a developer, technical architect, solution architect, project manager, and have held a number of management positions. Since 2012 I am again working primarily as a developer. In addition to deep technical understanding, my broad background also gives me a keen eye for my customers' organisational and business needs.

I am primarily motivated by professional growth and thus prefer to work with organisations that value quality, longevity and predictability, and that actively acquire, adapt and strive to deliver according to proven methodologies and best practices.

I am pragmatic when it comes to technology choice: I am analytically strong and have worked with a wide enough variety of technologies over the years to quickly wrap my head around and become productive with new languages, architectures, frameworks, backend systems and databases.

My resume is [here](https://andersblehr.co/cv.pdf) (in Norwegian only for the time being, until this site is up to par).
